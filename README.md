This is a repository about my projects on PowerBI. I have created reports on various topics.
1. Finance-Report
   You want to see a report on your latest sales figures. They request an executive summary of:
   a. Which month and year had the most profit?
   b. Where is the company seeing the most success (by country/region)?
   c. Which product and segment should the company continue to invest in?

2. Sales-Report
   You want to see an executive summary report on your latest sales figures that answers these specific questions:
   a. Which day had the most sales in February 2019?
   b. Which country/region is the company seeing the most success in?
   c. Which product category and reseller business types should the company continue to invest in?
